## Introduction

Welcome to the Ganges River Water Analysis and Visualization project repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of water quality in the Ganges River, India, utilizing satellite imagery, weather data, and water quality indices. The repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks that automate the retrieval of satellite and weather data, process the data, and generate visualizations to gain insights into the river's water quality.

## Motivation

The Ganges River is a vital water resource for millions of people and plays a crucial role in the ecosystem. Monitoring its water quality is essential for understanding environmental changes, ensuring the well-being of communities, and facilitating sustainable management practices. This project addresses the need for an integrated approach to water quality analysis, bringing together satellite imagery, weather data, and advanced analytics.

## Project Overview

The Ganges River Water Analysis and Visualization project encompass several key components:

1. **Satellite Image Processing:** The project utilizes Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect water bodies and calculate various water quality indices such as Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Turbidity Index, Chlorophyll Concentration, and Evapotranspiration Index.

2. **Weather Data Retrieval:** Weather data is obtained from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset using the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) API. The data includes information such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, cloud cover, and more.

3. **Data Integration and Analysis:** The retrieved satellite and weather data are integrated and analyzed to understand correlations and trends. The analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between weather conditions and water quality in the Ganges River.

4. **Visualization:** The project generates interactive visualizations, including 3D scatter plots, pair plots, and geographical maps, to present the analyzed data in an accessible and informative manner.

5. **Automated Reporting:** The repository includes scripts for generating automated reports in HTML format. These reports include interactive visualizations and key findings, making it easier to share and communicate results.
